//somtimes coin give more. 


//PROBLMS TO FIX
///If the player dies any coins that were collected should be lost and have to collect them again - 
//Sometimes the camera isn't following the player. Making it hard to see above or below if its safe to go there - TESTE
///first scene you can go through ceilling - TESTE
///Stage 2: i think you put 2 eggs at the end of the stage - TESTE
///Stage 3: near the bat and the blades on the left. I am going through the ground even when i am not near the edge. Cant clear level 3 cuz of it. - TESTE
///Stage 4: instant death. When I open the stage player character dies instantly - teste
///Stage 5: Bee’s stinger is moving really slowly. Platformers aren’t working properly. - teste
//Stage 7: its stage 3, and it has the same issues. - is he playing the level 7 instead of 3?
///Stage 8: No issues, but the stage is really short
//Stage 9: Maybe the bouncy pad is giving too much jump to the player character and making it seem like anti anti-gravity - TESTE
///Stage 10: instant death. When I open the stage player character dies instantly - TESTE
///Stage 11: The player is stuck in the ground and can't move. Spikes should be more into the ground so it's not visible. - teste
///put background
///add ground
//change the input.


//NEW PROBLEMS TO FIX
///getting stuck in ledges.
//controrls aree stiffer now
///stage 4 is insta death
///Stage 8: the jumping pad isn’t functioning well. And the character is getting stuck in it sometimes. (cant clear this stage because of it)
//Stage 11: Spikes dont kill you. You can walk on them and sometimes get stuck too. And stage dont end if you collect the egg.
//Stage 8-10 have issue of giving you blank screen before showing you stage.
///And you named stage 10 as 9.
///I don't see any other issue. But sometimes a coin would be counted as 2. Is that intentional or bug?
///Chameleon tongue can hit you through platform. Is it intended?
///But on the menu it says I have 60 gold even when i haven't played it.
